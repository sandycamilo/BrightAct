      <h5>The shadow pandemic - There has been a significant escalation of domestic violence worldwide.</h5>

    <div class= "covid1">
      <small>We see a shadow pandemic growing, of domestic violence by an intimate partner or family member.  
        As more countries report infection and lockdown, more domestic violence helplines and shelters 
        accross the world are reporting rising calls for help.
        <br>
        <br>
        Even before COVID-19, domestic violence was one of the greatest human rights violations. As the 
        COVID-19 pandemic continues, the numbed of victims is likey to grow with mutiple impacts on women's 
        wellbeing, sexual and reproductive health, mental health, and ability to participate and lead in the 
        recovery of our sociaties and economy.
      </small>
    </div>
    <div class="covid2">
      <small>Confinement is fostering the tension and strain created by security, health, and money worries.
        And it is increasing isolation for victims with violent partners, separating them from the people, 
        and resources that can best help them. It's a perfect storm for controlling, violent behaviour behind closed doors. 
        <br>
        <br>
        And in parallel, as health systems are stretching to breaking point, domestic violence shelters are also 
        reaching capacity, a service deficit made worse when centres are repurposed for additional COVID-response.
